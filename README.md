### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Lover of new technologies, self-taught by birth with a great passion for development, so I earn a living. I have more than 15 years of experience where I have been able to specialize in both backend,frontend and mobile, so I consider myself a fullstack programmer because I have been able to work with several programming languages.

Full stack developer with extensive knowledge in various technologies
